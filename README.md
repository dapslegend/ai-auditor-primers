# AI Auditor Primers
This repository contains open-source Primer documents to be ingested by AI prior to conducting smart contract audits.

The currently available Primers are:
* [Amy](https://github.com/devdacian/ai-auditor-primers/blob/main/primers/amy.vault.erc4626.primer.md) - Vault / [ERC4626](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/) Specialist AI Auditor
* [Base](https://github.com/devdacian/ai-auditor-primers/blob/main/primers/base.primer.md) - General Primer loaded with some heuristics that can be used as a base to evolve Specialist AIs

To learn how to use these Primers or evolve your own, read this [article](https://dacian.me/using-claude-to-evolve-specialist-ai-smart-contract-auditors) and this [post](https://x.com/DevDacian/status/1945790783493423525).
